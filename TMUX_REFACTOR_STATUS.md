# Tmux Host Refactor - Implementation Status

## Summary
Partial implementation of the host-based tmux session management system as per the plan in `plans/tmux-host-refactor.md`. This replaces Docker containers with direct tmux sessions running on the host machine.

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Remove Container Dependencies ✅
- **Removed Docker dependencies from Cargo.toml**
  - Removed `bollard` (Docker API client)
  - Added `portable-pty`, `signal-hook`, `signal-hook-tokio`, `libc` for terminal handling
  - Updated `nix` features for PTY support
  
- **Deleted Docker modules and files**
  - Removed `src/docker/` directory
  - Removed `src/config/container.rs`
  - Removed `docker/` directory with Dockerfiles

- **Updated Session Model**
  - Modified `src/models/session.rs` to use tmux fields instead of container fields
  - Added `tmux_session_name` and `tmux_pid` fields
  - Added new session states: Created, Attached, Detached
  - Added `worktree_path` and `environment_vars` fields

### Phase 2: Implement Host Tmux Session Management ✅
- **Created tmux module structure**
  - `src/tmux/mod.rs` - Module definition
  - `src/tmux/error.rs` - Error types for tmux operations
  - `src/tmux/session.rs` - Core TmuxSession implementation

- **Implemented TmuxSession**
  - Session creation with detached tmux sessions
  - PTY-based communication
  - Session attachment/detachment
  - Pane content capture
  - Window resize support
  - Session listing and cleanup

### Phase 3: Session Manager (Partial) ⚠️
- **Created SessionManager**
  - `src/session/manager.rs` - Session lifecycle management
  - Integration with WorktreeManager for git worktrees
  - Session creation, attachment, detachment operations

- **Updated lib.rs**
  - Added `tmux` and `session` modules
  - Removed `docker` module reference

- **Created stub implementations**
  - Stubbed out ContainerTemplate types for compatibility
  - Simplified SessionLoader to work without Docker

## Current State

### What Works
- Tmux module compiles independently
- Session model updated with tmux fields
- Basic session manager structure in place
- Test program created (`examples/test_tmux.rs`)

### Known Issues
1. **Compilation Errors (~51 errors remaining)**
   - Many components still reference Docker/container code
   - Type mismatches with nix 0.27 (OwnedFd vs RawFd)
   - Missing match arms for new SessionStatus variants
   - AppState still needs significant refactoring

2. **Incomplete Components**
   - Phase 4: TUI components not updated
   - Phase 5: Session persistence not implemented
   - Window resize monitoring not integrated
   - Main loop still references Docker

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. Fix remaining compilation errors
   - Update components to handle new SessionStatus variants
   - Fix nix type issues (OwnedFd vs RawFd)
   - Complete AppState refactoring

2. Update TUI Components (Phase 4)
   - Session list component
   - Attached terminal component
   - Event handling for tmux

3. Integration Testing
   - Test tmux session creation/attachment
   - Verify PTY communication
   - Test Ctrl+Q detachment

### Medium Priority
4. Session Persistence (Phase 5)
   - Save/load sessions from disk
   - Restore sessions on startup

5. Polish and Optimization
   - Window resize support
   - Performance tuning
   - Error handling improvements

## Testing
To test the tmux integration independently:
```bash
cargo run --example test_tmux
```

## Dependencies
- tmux must be installed on the host system
- Git worktrees are used for file isolation
- Claude CLI should be available for optimal experience

## Migration Notes
- Existing Docker-based sessions cannot be migrated
- Users need tmux installed locally
- Environment variables must be configured on host
- Session data will be stored in `~/.config/ciab/sessions.json`
