**Generated**: 2025-07-17 11:27:45  
**Session ID**: git-worktree-error-fix-session

## Session Summary

### Health Status
- **Current Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Healthy - Critical issue resolved successfully
- **Message Count**: ~45/50
- **Recommendation**: Ready for new tasks or session continuation

### Operating Context
- **Mode**: BUILD - Debugging and fixing critical git worktree errors
- **Scope**: MEDIUM - Complex git worktree path resolution bug
- **Branch**: main

## Task Progress

### Current Task
- **Title**: Fix "Cannot determine main repository path" error in git worktree loading
- **Phase**: COMPLETED âœ…
- **Progress**: 100%

### Completed Items
âœ… Add debug logging to find_main_repository function to understand the parsing failure  
âœ… Add better error messages with context about what paths are being parsed  
âœ… Add validation to ensure computed main repository path exists  
âœ… Test the fix with existing worktrees to ensure they load correctly  

### In Progress
None - all tasks completed successfully

### Pending Items
None - all critical issues resolved

## Technical Context

### Current Working Files
- **Last File**: `/Users/stevengonsalvez/d/git/claude-docker/src/git/worktree_manager.rs`
- **Last Function**: `find_main_repository` (lines 369-464)
- **Last Command**: `RUST_LOG=debug cargo run` (testing the fix)

### Code Changes This Session
Key changes made to fix the git worktree loading error:

**1. Fixed Repository Path Resolution (src/git/worktree_manager.rs:369-464)**
- **Root Cause**: `find_main_repository` function was using `worktree_repo.path().parent()` instead of `worktree_repo.workdir()` to locate the `.git` file
- **Problem**: This caused it to look in the git metadata directory instead of the actual worktree directory
- **Solution**: Changed to use `worktree_repo.workdir()` to get the correct worktree working directory

**2. Improved Path Validation Logic**
- **Issue**: Function was looking for `.git` inside a `.git` directory (invalid)
- **Fix**: Added logic to detect when computed path is a `.git` directory and return the parent repository directory instead
- **Validation**: Added proper existence checks for both directory structures

**3. Enhanced Debugging and Error Messages**
- Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the path resolution process
- Improved error messages to include specific paths and context
- Added tracing for: session path resolution, symlink resolution, git file content, parsed paths, and final computed paths

**4. Return Value Correction**
- **Problem**: Function was returning `.git` directory path instead of repository directory path
- **Solution**: Added logic to return the repository directory (parent of `.git`) when appropriate

## To Resume This Session

1. **Load Session State**
   ```
   All critical issues have been resolved - no urgent session state to resume
   ```

2. **Verify Git Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git status
   ```

3. **Continue From**
   - File: All git worktree fixes are complete and working
   - Task: Ready for new development tasks
   - Next steps: The application now successfully loads existing sessions and worktrees. Consider implementing Phase 5 features (Interactive session management UI) or address any other pending issues.

## Important Notes

### Success Metrics Achieved
- âœ… **Error Resolution**: "Cannot determine main repository path" error completely eliminated
- âœ… **Session Loading**: Application now successfully loads 1 workspace with active sessions (previously 0)
- âœ… **Path Resolution**: All git worktree paths now correctly resolve to repository directories
- âœ… **Debugging Enhanced**: Complete visibility into path resolution process for future troubleshooting

### Technical Understanding
- **Worktree Structure**: Application correctly handles the symlink structure in `~/.claude-in-a-box/worktrees/by-session/` pointing to `by-name/` directories
- **Git Integration**: libgit2 Repository API correctly used with `workdir()` instead of `path().parent()`
- **Path Validation**: Robust handling of both `.git` directory paths and repository directory paths

### Log Analysis
- Debug logs show successful path resolution for all existing sessions (d1d880d4, 8eb3f449, 7b427950, 363fca74)
- Final main repository path correctly computed as `/Users/stevengonsalvez/d/git/claude-docker`
- Application successfully identifies orphaned worktrees and loads active sessions

## Blockers/Issues
None - all reported issues have been resolved successfully

**Key Takeaway**: The git worktree loading system is now fully functional. Users can view and manage their existing development sessions without the "Cannot determine main repository path" error that was preventing session discovery.
