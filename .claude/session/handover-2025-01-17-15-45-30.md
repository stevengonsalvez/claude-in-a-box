- **Last Command**: `docker build -t claude-box:claude-dev .`

### Code Changes This Session
Key changes made:

**1. Logging System Overhaul (src/main.rs:133)**
- Replaced stderr logging with file-based logging to ~/.claude-box/logs/
- Added timestamp-based log file naming (claude-box-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log)
- Removed ANSI colors from log files
- Created log directory structure automatically

**2. Event Logging Cleanup (src/app/events.rs)**
- Removed verbose info! logging statements that were cluttering output
- Preserved essential error logging while eliminating noise
- Removed unused tracing::info import

**3. Docker Image Infrastructure**
- Built complete claude-box:claude-dev image (1.11GB)
- Created supporting files:
  - .claude/CLAUDE.md (container documentation)
  - .env (environment variables template)
  - .claude.json (authentication placeholder)  
  - install-mcp-servers.sh (MCP server installation script)
- Fixed Dockerfile issues:
  - Changed UID from 1000 to 1001 (avoiding node user conflict)
  - Commented out optional Gemini file copying
  - Added proper error handling for optional components

## To Resume This Session
