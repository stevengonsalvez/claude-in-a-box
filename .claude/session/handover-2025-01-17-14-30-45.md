# Session Handover Document
*Generated: 2025-01-17 14:30:45*

## Session Health Status
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Healthy (within normal operation range)
- **Current Mode**: Development
- **Session Scope**: MEDIUM (Multi-component UI fixes and testing)

## Project Context
**Project**: Claude-in-a-Box TUI Development
**Repository**: `/Users/stevengonsalvez/d/git/claude-docker`
**Branch**: `main`

## Current Task Status

### âœ… Recently Completed
1. **Repository Auto-discovery Enhancement** - Added configurable workspace scan paths to find user repositories in custom locations
2. **Dual Session Creation Modes** - Split functionality: 'n' for current directory, 's' for search all workspaces
3. **UI Improvements** - Implemented scrollable lists, type-to-filter, and fixed text overlay issues
4. **Race Condition Fix** - Resolved escape key issue in search workspace view with cancellation flags
5. **Comprehensive Testing** - Created full UI test suite with 15 tests covering all escape scenarios

### ðŸ”„ Current Issue (Active)
**Critical Bug**: Escape key from new session ('n' key) view shows broken screen with logs instead of returning to main screen cleanly.

**User Report**: "clicking new and then without creating the session escaping has a broken screen view. it should come with the home screen view. Also probably all logs for the claude box should be logged into a log file rather than the stdout, which I think is breaking the screen view"

## Technical Analysis

### Root Cause Investigation
The issue appears to be that application logs are being written to stdout, which interferes with the TUI rendering. When escaping from new session view, logs are displayed on screen instead of a clean return to SessionList view.

### Files Currently Under Investigation
1. `/Users/stevengonsalvez/d/git/claude-docker/src/app/events.rs` - Event handling system
2. `/Users/stevengonsalvez/d/git/claude-docker/src/app/state.rs` - State management
3. `/Users/stevengonsalvez/d/git/claude-docker/src/main.rs` - Main application and logging setup

### Key Findings
- Current logging setup: `with_writer(std::io::stderr)` in main.rs (line updated previously)
- Escape key handling works correctly in search workspace view after race condition fix
- New session ('n' key) creates `View::NewSession` but escape handling may have logging interference
- All 15 UI tests pass, indicating core event handling logic is correct

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate Actions
1. **Investigate New Session Escape** - Debug why escape from `View::NewSession` shows logs on screen
2. **Log File Redirection** - Implement proper log file output instead of stderr/stdout
3. **Clean State Transitions** - Ensure all view transitions are clean without log interference

### Implementation Plan
1. **Audit Logging Output**:
   - Check all `info!()`, `warn!()`, `error!()` calls in the codebase
   - Verify they're not accidentally writing to stdout
   - Implement file-based logging with rotation

2. **Debug New Session View**:
   - Test escape key specifically from `View::NewSession`
   - Compare with working escape from `View::SearchWorkspace`
   - Identify where logs are being displayed

3. **Fix State Management**:
   - Ensure `cancel_new_session()` cleanly returns to `View::SessionList`
   - Add proper error handling for view transitions

### Testing Strategy
- Run existing UI tests to ensure no regression
- Add specific test for new session escape scenario
- Test with actual application to verify fix

## Technical Context

### Architecture Overview
- **TUI Framework**: Ratatui with crossterm for terminal handling
- **Event System**: Async event processing with race condition protection
- **State Management**: Centralized AppState with view transitions
- **Testing**: Custom UITestFramework with TestBackend for headless testing

### Key Components
- `EventHandler`: Processes keyboard input and generates events
- `AppState`: Manages application state and view transitions
- `NewSessionState`: Handles session creation workflow
- `View` enum: Controls which UI component is active

### Recent Fixes Applied
- **Race Condition**: Added `async_operation_cancelled` flag to prevent async operations from overriding user cancellation
- **Escape Key Priority**: Fixed global help toggle to work from any view
- **UI Scrolling**: Implemented ListState for proper scrolling in filtered lists
- **Text Overlay**: Added solid backgrounds to prevent text bleeding

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain with cargo
- Docker for container management
- Git for version control

### Build Commands
```bash
# Build application
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run UI tests specifically
cargo test ui_tests

# Run application
cargo run
```

### Key Dependencies
- `ratatui`: TUI framework
- `crossterm`: Terminal handling
- `tokio`: Async runtime
- `tracing`: Logging framework
- `bollard`: Docker integration

## Debugging Information

### Current Log Setup (main.rs)
```rust
.with_writer(std::io::stderr) // Write to stderr to avoid interfering with TUI
```

### Working Escape Pattern (SearchWorkspace)
- User presses 's' â†’ `View::SearchWorkspace`
- User presses Escape â†’ `AppEvent::NewSessionCancel`
- State calls `cancel_new_session()` â†’ `View::SessionList`
- Clean transition, no logs displayed

### Broken Escape Pattern (NewSession)
- User presses 'n' â†’ `View::NewSession`
- User presses Escape â†’ Should call `AppEvent::NewSessionCancel`
- Expected: Clean return to `View::SessionList`
- **Actual**: Logs displayed on screen, broken UI

## Session Continuation Instructions

### For Next Developer
1. **Start Here**: Focus on the escape key issue from new session view
2. **Reproduce**: Press 'n' then Escape and observe the broken screen
3. **Compare**: Working escape from search ('s' then Escape) vs broken escape from new session
4. **Fix Strategy**: Implement proper log file redirection and ensure clean state transitions

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/stevengonsalvez/d/git/claude-docker

# Build and run
cargo run

# Test the issue
# 1. Run application
# 2. Press 'n' (new session)
# 3. Press Escape
# 4. Observe: Should return to main screen but shows logs instead
```

### Configuration Context
- User has repositories in `/Users/stevengonsalvez/d/git`
- Application uses workspace scanning with configurable paths
- Container templates based on claude-docker integration

## Important Notes

### User Feedback
- "still the same issue - escape on that screen does not return to the main screen"
- "logs should go to log file rather than stdout"
- User expects clean return to main screen from any view

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain terminal TUI without log interference
- All 15 UI tests must continue to pass
- Preserve existing functionality while fixing the bug

### Success Criteria
1. Escape from new session view returns cleanly to main screen
2. No logs displayed on TUI interface
3. All existing UI tests pass
4. Log output redirected to appropriate log file

**Handover Complete**: Ready for continuation with focus on new session escape key fix and log file implementation.

**Priority**: HIGH - Critical user experience issue affecting core functionality.
