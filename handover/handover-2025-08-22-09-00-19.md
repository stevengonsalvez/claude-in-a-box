# Session Handover Document
**Generated**: 2025-08-22 09:00:19  
**Session Health**: üü¢ Healthy (Early in session)  
**Current Branch**: main  
**Mode**: BUILD  

## Executive Summary
Working on fixing the authentication flow issue in claude-in-a-box where Claude CLI starts an interactive session after OAuth completion, requiring users to press Ctrl+C twice to exit. The repository was reset to commit e5e8518 after multiple unsuccessful fix attempts. User has a new idea for fixing the auth issue that hasn't been shared yet.

## Current Task
**Task ID**: AUTH-FIX-001  
**Phase**: Planning  
**Progress**: 0% - Awaiting user's new approach  

### Problem Statement
When running the auth script for the first time:
1. OAuth authentication completes successfully
2. Claude CLI automatically starts an interactive session
3. User must press Ctrl+C twice to exit back to the container workspace
4. Desired behavior: Clean auth flow that exits immediately after authentication

### Previous Attempts (All Rolled Back)
1. **Expect Script Approach**: Tried to handle interactive session with expect - Failed due to trust dialog issues
2. **Process Monitoring**: Attempted to monitor OAuth completion and kill Claude process - Caused raw mode errors
3. **Raw Mode Prevention**: Redirected stdin and set environment variables - OAuth URL stopped appearing
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Combined monitoring with normal execution - Raw mode errors persisted

## Active Todos
```
1. ‚è≥ Analyze current auth flow behavior
2. ‚è≥ Implement user's new idea for auth fix  
3. ‚è≥ Test the new auth flow
```

## Technical Context

### Key Files
- `/docker/claude-dev/scripts/auth-setup.sh` - Main authentication setup script (line 118-120: claude auth login)
- `/docker/claude-dev/Dockerfile` - Container definition
- `/src/app/state.rs` - TUI's auth container execution logic
- `/src/main.rs` - Contains run_auth_setup() function for CLI auth command

### Current Git Status
```
## main...origin/main
 D test_cli_git.sh
 D test_cli_git_no_gpg.sh
?? .claude/action-summaries/
?? HANDOVER.md
```

### Container Status
- Image: claude-dev:latest (just rebuilt after reset)
- Base: node:20-slim
- Claude CLI: @anthropic-ai/claude-code installed globally

## Important Notes for Next Session

### Critical Information
1. **Repository Reset**: Code is at commit e5e8518 (before any auth fixes)
2. **User Has New Idea**: User explicitly stated they have a new approach but hasn't shared it yet
3. **Container Rebuilt**: Fresh container image built from reset codebase
4. **Previous Approaches Failed**: Multiple technical approaches tried and rolled back

### User Requirements
- Auth should work seamlessly when starting claude-in-a-box
- No manual intervention required after OAuth completion
- Clean exit from auth flow without Ctrl+C
- User should NOT need to run a separate auth command

### Known Issues
1. `claude auth login` automatically starts interactive session after OAuth
2. Raw mode errors when trying to prevent interactive session
3. OAuth URL must be visible to user for authentication
4. Trust dialog appears after authentication

## Resume Instructions

### To Continue This Work:
1. Ask user about their new idea for fixing the auth issue
2. Review `/docker/claude-dev/scripts/auth-setup.sh` current implementation
3. Understand the auth flow: OAuth ‚Üí Credentials written ‚Üí Claude starts interactive session
4. Implement user's new approach
5. Test in fresh container with no existing auth

### Testing Commands:
```bash
# Build container
cd docker/claude-dev && docker build -t claude-dev:latest .

# Test auth flow (from project root)
cargo run

# Clean auth state for testing
rm -rf ~/.claude/  # Be careful with this!
```

### Environment Context
- Platform: darwin (macOS)
- Working Directory: /Users/stevengonsalvez/d/git/claude-in-a-box
- User: stevengonsalvez (Stevie)

## Handoff Notes
User explicitly requested to "reset all files back" and stated "we will start again, I have another idea". The next step is to wait for and implement their new approach to fixing the authentication flow issue. All previous attempts have been rolled back, and we're starting fresh from the original codebase.

## Contact & Escalation
For questions about this handover, refer to the git history at commit e5e8518 for the baseline state before auth fix attempts.
