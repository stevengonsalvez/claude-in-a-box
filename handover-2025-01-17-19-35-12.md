**Branch**: main  

## Session Summary

### Health Status
- **Current Status**: 🟢 Healthy - Session deletion feature fully implemented and debugged
- **Message Count**: ~85/50 (Extended session due to complex implementation)
- **Recommendation**: Feature ready for testing and validation

### Operating Context
- **Mode**: BUILD - Implementation and debugging of session deletion functionality
- **Scope**: MEDIUM - Session deletion with confirmation dialog and proper cleanup
- **Branch**: main
- **Working Directory**: `/Users/stevengonsalvez/d/git/claude-in-a-box`

## Task Progress

### Current Task
- **Title**: Implement session deletion with confirmation dialog and proper cleanup
- **Phase**: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ✅
- **Progress**: 100%

### Completed Items
✅ Investigate current session deletion implementation  
✅ Add confirmation dialog state to AppState  
✅ Implement session deletion with confirmation  
✅ Add confirmation dialog UI component  
✅ Test session deletion workflow  
✅ Debug and fix orphaned worktree deletion issue  
✅ Consolidate directory structure from ~/.claude-box to ~/.claude-in-a-box  

### Issue Resolution
**Root Cause Identified**: Session deletion was failing because:
- SessionLifecycleManager only handles sessions with active containers
- UI displayed "orphaned worktrees" (sessions without containers)
- Original deletion logic couldn't find sessions that existed only as worktrees

**Solution Implemented**: Updated deletion logic to handle both scenarios:
1. Active sessions (with containers) → Uses SessionLifecycleManager
2. Orphaned worktrees (no containers) → Uses WorktreeManager directly

## Technical Context

### Key Files Modified
- **`src/app/state.rs`**: Added confirmation dialog state, deletion logic, and debug logging
- **`src/app/events.rs`**: Added confirmation dialog event handling
- **`src/components/confirmation_dialog.rs`**: NEW - Confirmation dialog component
- **`src/components/layout.rs`**: Integrated confirmation dialog rendering
- **`src/components/mod.rs`**: Added confirmation dialog module

### Architecture Overview

#### Session Discovery System
The homepage uses a **hybrid approach** for displaying sessions:
1. **Docker containers** (primary) - Scans for containers with `claude-managed=true`
2. **Git worktrees** (secondary) - Scans `~/.claude-in-a-box/worktrees/by-session/`
3. **Combines both** to show comprehensive session status

#### Directory Structure (Consolidated)
```
~/.claude-in-a-box/
├── config/           # Configuration files (was ~/.claude-box/)
│   └── config.toml   # Global user configuration
├── logs/             # Application logs (was ~/.claude-box/logs/)
│   └── claude-in-a-box-*.log
└── worktrees/        # Git worktrees
    ├── by-session/   # Session UUID symlinks
    └── by-name/      # Human-readable directories
```

#### Session Status Logic
- **● Running**: Container state is "running"
- **⏸ Stopped**: Container is "paused", "exited", "dead" OR no container exists
- **✗ Error**: Unknown container state or Docker failures

### Code Changes Summary

#### 1. Confirmation Dialog System
```rust
// New state structures
pub struct ConfirmationDialog {
    pub title: String,
    pub message: String,
    pub confirm_action: ConfirmAction,
    pub selected_option: bool, // true = Yes, false = No
}

pub enum ConfirmAction {
    DeleteSession(Uuid),
}
```

#### 2. Enhanced Deletion Logic
```rust
// Handles both active sessions and orphaned worktrees
match manager.remove_session(session_id).await {
    Ok(_) => {
        info!("Session removed through lifecycle manager");
    }
    Err(e) => {
        warn!("Session not found in lifecycle manager: {}", e);
        // Remove orphaned worktree directly
        let worktree_manager = WorktreeManager::new()?;
        worktree_manager.remove_worktree(session_id)?;
    }
}
```

#### 3. Event Handling
- **ConfirmationToggle**: Switch between Yes/No options
- **ConfirmationConfirm**: Execute selected action
- **ConfirmationCancel**: Cancel dialog

#### 4. UI Integration
- Confirmation dialog renders as highest priority overlay
- Keyboard navigation: Tab/Arrow keys to toggle, Enter to confirm, Esc to cancel
- Visual feedback for selected option

### Configuration Changes
- **Directory consolidation**: All paths now use `~/.claude-in-a-box/` as root
- **Config parsing**: Made `version` field optional to fix parsing errors
- **Documentation**: Updated README.md, CLAUDE.md, and templates

## Testing Status

### Debugging Results
Recent test logs showed:
```
INFO Before deletion: 1 workspaces, 2 sessions
WARN Session not found in lifecycle manager: Session not found: [session-id]
INFO Attempting to remove orphaned worktree directly
INFO Successfully removed orphaned worktree
INFO After deletion: 1 workspaces, 1 sessions
```

### Expected Behavior
1. Press `d` on selected session → Shows confirmation dialog
2. Navigate with Tab/Arrow keys → Highlight Yes/No options
3. Press Enter on "Yes" → Session deleted with full cleanup
4. UI refreshes → Session removed from display

### Test Commands
```bash
# Run with debug logging
RUST_LOG=info cargo run

# Check logs
tail -f ~/.claude-in-a-box/logs/claude-in-a-box-*.log

# Build project
cargo build --quiet
```

## Implementation Details

### User Workflow
1. **Press `d`** while a session is selected → Shows confirmation dialog
2. **Navigate** with Tab/Arrow keys between "Yes" and "No" (defaults to "No")
3. **Press Enter** to confirm action or **Esc** to cancel
4. **If confirmed** → Session gets deleted with full cleanup:
   - Container is stopped and removed (if exists)
   - Git worktree is removed
   - Session is removed from workspace list
   - UI selection is updated appropriately

### Technical Flow
1. **User confirmation** → `DeleteSession` event → `AsyncAction::DeleteSession`
2. **Async processing** → `delete_session()` method
3. **Dual cleanup strategy**:
   - Try SessionLifecycleManager first (for active sessions)
   - Fall back to WorktreeManager (for orphaned worktrees)
4. **UI refresh** → `load_real_workspaces()` to update display

## To Resume This Session

### Current State
- **Feature Status**: Implementation complete and tested
- **Code Quality**: All functionality working, only warnings (no errors)
- **Testing**: Manual testing successful, automated tests may be needed

### Next Steps
1. **Validation Testing**: Test with various session states (running, stopped, orphaned)
2. **Edge Case Testing**: Test with empty workspaces, multiple sessions
3. **User Experience**: Verify confirmation dialog behavior and keyboard navigation
4. **Performance**: Test with many sessions/workspaces

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Test the implementation
cargo run
# In app: press 'd' on a session, confirm deletion

# Check logs for debugging
cat ~/.claude-in-a-box/logs/claude-in-a-box-*.log | grep -E "(Deleting|deletion|Successfully)"
```
