**Project:** claude-in-a-box  
**Session Type:** OAuth Authentication Fix  

## Session Health Status

ðŸŸ¢ **Session Complete** - All major objectives achieved  
**Message Count:** ~150 messages  
**Session Quality:** High - Complex technical issue successfully resolved  

## Executive Summary

Successfully fixed OAuth authentication in claude-in-a-box that was causing cross-platform compatibility issues and poor user experience due to terminal window spawning. Implemented a containerized OAuth flow that works within the same terminal/TUI interface.

## Completed Tasks

âœ… **OAuth Authentication Flow Fixed**
- Replaced terminal window spawning with interactive container execution
- OAuth now runs within the same terminal as claude-box TUI
- Temporarily exits TUI, runs auth container with TTY, returns to TUI

âœ… **Credential Mount Path Issues Resolved**
- Fixed incorrect mount that was overwriting entire `.claude` directory
- Now mounts individual files: `.credentials.json` and `.claude.json`
- Credentials properly accessible to session containers

âœ… **Cross-platform Compatibility**
- Eliminated platform-specific terminal spawning issues
- Works consistently on macOS, Linux, Windows
- No more "hyper legacy client" Docker connection errors

âœ… **Auth Script Updates**
- Updated `docker/claude-dev/scripts/auth-setup.sh` to support both OAuth and API token methods
- Added persistence logic for `.claude.json` configuration file
- Environment variable support for authentication method selection

## Technical Changes Made

### 1. OAuth Setup Function (`src/app/state.rs:1064-1195`)
**Before:** Complex Docker API container creation with log streaming
**After:** Simple interactive container execution with terminal mode switching

```rust
// Key changes:
- Uses `docker run -it` for interactive execution
- Temporarily exits TUI with disable_raw_mode() and LeaveAlternateScreen
- Re-enters TUI after auth completion
- Added AUTH_METHOD=oauth environment variable
```

### 2. Container Mount Configuration (`src/docker/session_lifecycle.rs:644-670`)
**Before:** Mounting entire auth directory to `/home/claude-user/.claude`
**After:** Individual file mounts to correct paths

```rust
// Fixed mount paths:
~/.claude-in-a-box/auth/.credentials.json â†’ /home/claude-user/.claude/.credentials.json
~/.claude-in-a-box/auth/.claude.json â†’ /home/claude-user/.claude.json
```

### 3. Auth Script Updates (`docker/claude-dev/scripts/auth-setup.sh:68-109`)
**Added:** 
- Support for `AUTH_METHOD` environment variable (oauth/token)
- Logic to copy `.claude.json` to mounted directory for persistence
- Better error handling and user guidance

## Files Modified

1. **`src/app/state.rs`** - OAuth setup function complete rewrite
2. **`src/docker/session_lifecycle.rs`** - Fixed credential mounting logic
3. **`docker/claude-dev/scripts/auth-setup.sh`** - Enhanced auth script

## Current Status

**Working State:** âœ… All functionality operational
**Branch:** main (committed: be3a401, 2370a9b)
**Testing:** OAuth flow tested and working
**Documentation:** Updated inline comments

## User Experience Improvements

- **Before**: OAuth opened new terminal windows, caused confusion, cross-platform issues
- **After**: OAuth runs seamlessly within claude-box interface, consistent experience

## Technical Architecture

The solution uses a "temporary TUI exit" pattern:
1. User selects OAuth in TUI
2. TUI exits raw mode and alternate screen
3. Interactive container runs with full TTY access
4. User completes OAuth in same terminal
5. TUI re-enters raw mode and resumes

This pattern could be reused for other interactive operations that need full terminal access.

## Known Limitations

1. **Claude CLI Version Dependency**: Current implementation relies on Claude CLI supporting `claude auth login`
2. **Container Requirement**: Requires Docker and claude-dev image to be built
3. **File Permissions**: Mounted credential files are read-only for security

## Next Steps (If Continuing)

**Immediate:**
- No immediate work required - OAuth authentication is fully functional

**Future Enhancements:**
- Consider adding OAuth refresh token handling
- Add support for multiple authentication profiles
- Implement auth status checking in TUI

**Potential Issues to Monitor:**
- Claude CLI version changes affecting OAuth commands
- File permission issues on different platforms
- Container image build failures

## Testing Instructions

To verify OAuth authentication works:

1. Remove existing credentials: `rm -f ~/.claude-in-a-box/auth/.credentials.json`
2. Run claude-box: `cargo run`
3. Select "Set up Authentication" 
4. Choose "OAuth" method
5. Complete browser OAuth flow
6. Verify credentials created in `~/.claude-in-a-box/auth/`
7. Create new session to test credential mounting

## Context for Next Developer

**Problem Solved:** OAuth authentication was opening new terminal windows causing UX and cross-platform issues

**Solution Approach:** Interactive container execution within same terminal using TTY mode switching

**Key Insight:** Rather than trying to extract OAuth URLs from container logs, we let the user interact directly with Claude CLI in an interactive container

**Architecture Decision:** Individual file mounts instead of directory mounts to avoid overwriting container's `.claude` directory structure

## Emergency Contacts

**Previous Implementation:** See commit 61bd8a0 for original OAuth implementation with terminal spawning
**Rollback Point:** Commit 4d31185 before OAuth changes if needed
**Documentation:** All changes documented in commit messages and inline comments
