# Session Handover Document: Permissions Implementation

**Generated**: 2025-01-24  
**Session ID**: permissions-implementation-pivot

## Executive Summary

We implemented a comprehensive permissions control system for Claude CLI in containers, but discovered that the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag itself triggers an unavoidable warning dialog. A pivot to using non-interactive mode (`-p` flag) is proposed.

## Implementation Summary

### What Was Built

1. **UI Layer** - Added permissions configuration step:
   - New step `ConfigurePermissions` in session creation flow
   - Toggle between "Keep permission prompts" and "Skip permission prompts"
   - Space bar toggles the option

2. **State Management** - Threaded `skip_permissions` through the entire stack:
   - `NewSessionState.skip_permissions` field
   - `SessionRequest.skip_permissions` field  
   - `Session.skip_permissions` field in model
   - Environment variable `CLAUDE_CONTINUE_FLAG` set in container

3. **Docker Integration** - Two fixes were needed:
   - **FIX 1**: Added `skip_permissions` handling to unified session creation path
   - **FIX 2**: Fixed shell script expansion using `eval` for proper argument parsing

4. **Script Updates** - Conditional trust dialog configuration:
   - Only set `hasTrustDialogAccepted true` when skip permissions is enabled
   - Use direct binary path to avoid wrapper recursion

### The Core Issue

Despite all fixes, the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag **itself** shows an unavoidable warning dialog:

```
WARNING: Claude Code running in Bypass Permissions mode

In Bypass Permissions mode, Claude Code will not ask for your approval before 
running potentially dangerous commands...

1. No, exit
2. Yes, I accept
```

This dialog appears **because of** the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag, not despite it. There's no way to bypass this warning - it's a security feature of Claude CLI.

## Technical Analysis

### Current Flow
1. User selects "Skip permission prompts" in TUI
2. `CLAUDE_CONTINUE_FLAG='--dangerously-skip-permissions'` is set ‚úÖ
3. Scripts run `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` 
4. **Claude shows bypass warning dialog** ‚ùå
5. After accepting, commands run without individual prompts

### Root Cause
- `hasTrustDialogAccepted` only skips the general trust dialog
- `--dangerously-skip-permissions` **always** shows its own warning dialog
- This is by design for security - no config can bypass it

## Proposed Solution: Non-Interactive Mode

Instead of interactive mode with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, use:

```bash
claude -p "user query here" --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

### Benefits
1. **No interactive warning dialog** - The `-p` flag runs in print mode
2. **Logs are streamable** - Output goes to stdout, perfect for container logs
3. **Input via TUI** - User types in TUI, we pass to Claude
4. **Full visibility** - All execution is logged and visible

### Implementation Plan

1. **Change Container Entry**:
   - Don't start interactive Claude session
   - Keep container running with a simple loop
   - Accept commands via a named pipe or file

2. **TUI Chat Interface**:
   - Add chat input in TUI
   - Send queries to container
   - Stream responses back to live logs

3. **Command Execution**:
   ```bash
   # Instead of interactive:
   claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
   
   # Use print mode:
   claude -p "$USER_QUERY" --dangerously-skip-permissions
   ```

## Files Modified

### Rust Application
- `src/app/state.rs` - Added `skip_permissions` to `NewSessionState`
- `src/app/events.rs` - Added permission toggle event handling
- `src/components/new_session.rs` - Added permissions UI step
- `src/models/session.rs` - Added `skip_permissions` field
- `src/docker/session_lifecycle.rs` - Fixed unified session creation path
- `src/docker/claude_dev.rs` - Sets `CLAUDE_CONTINUE_FLAG` environment variable

### Container Scripts  
- `docker/claude-dev/scripts/startup.sh` - Conditional trust dialog
- `docker/claude-dev/scripts/claude-logging.sh` - Fixed shell expansion with `eval`
- `docker/claude-dev/scripts/start-claude-interactive.sh` - Direct binary for config
- `docker/claude-dev/scripts/session-bashrc.sh` - Claude wrapper function

## Current State

- ‚úÖ Permissions preference is captured in UI
- ‚úÖ Flag is correctly passed to container environment
- ‚úÖ Shell scripts properly expand the flag
- ‚ùå Interactive mode shows unavoidable warning dialog
- üîÑ Need to pivot to non-interactive approach

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Chat in TUI**:
   - Add input field for Claude queries
   - Send to container via file or pipe
   - Stream responses to live logs

2. **Update Container Scripts**:
   - Remove interactive Claude startup
   - Add command listener loop
   - Execute with `-p` flag

3. **Benefits**:
   - No warning dialogs
   - Full log visibility
   - Better integration with TUI
   - Cleaner architecture

## Lessons Learned

1. **Security by Design**: Some security features (like the bypass warning) cannot be circumvented
2. **Interactive vs Non-Interactive**: Non-interactive modes often work better in containers
3. **Flag Complexity**: Shell expansion of flags requires careful handling with `eval`
4. **Testing First**: Should have tested the flag behavior before full implementation

## Recommendation

Pivot to the non-interactive approach. It provides a better user experience, avoids the unsolvable warning dialog, and integrates more naturally with the TUI's log streaming capabilities.
